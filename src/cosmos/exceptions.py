    A malformed YAML file, a field that fails validation, an expectation that
    does not exist, or an action that the source kind does not support. Raised by
    the loader and by parse-time validators, before any data is read.

    Retrying does not help: the file has to change. The run aborts and no source object
    is validated.

    A corrupt CSV, a file that cannot be parsed, a schema that does not match.
    Raised by the reader once it recognises a failure as belonging to the data
    rather than to the environment.

    The source object is recorded and dead-lettered according to ``on_failure``, and the
    run continues with the remaining source objects: a partial run that is recorded
    beats an aborted one that leaves the day missing from the report.
